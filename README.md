# AIML-TASK-2 
🧪 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Objective

The goal of this task is to understand the dataset through descriptive statistics and visualizations. Exploratory Data Analysis helps reveal patterns, trends, relationships, and anomalies that guide further model building.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Pandas – Data manipulation and summary statistics

Matplotlib – Basic visualizations

Seaborn – Advanced statistical plots

Plotly – Interactive visualizations (optional)

📂 Dataset

You can use any dataset of your choice.

📘 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Summary Statistics

Generated key descriptive statistics such as:

Mean, median, mode

Standard deviation

Min & max values

Count of missing values

This helps understand the overall distribution and quality of data.

2️⃣ Univariate Analysis

Created visualizations for individual features:

Histograms → show frequency distribution

Boxplots → detect outliers

Useful for understanding the data spread and identifying skewness/outliers.

3️⃣ Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis

Explored relationships between variables:

Correlation matrix (heatmap)

Pairplots to observe patterns

This helps identify which features are strongly related.

4️⃣ Pattern & Trend Identification

Based on visualizations, identified:

Feature importance patterns

Trends (e.g., survival rate by gender/age in Titanic dataset)

Anomalies or unusual points in data

5️⃣ Insights & Inferences

Summarized meaningful observations from EDA, such as:

Distribution characteristics

Key relationships between variables

Any potential issues (missing values, outliers, imbalance, etc.)
